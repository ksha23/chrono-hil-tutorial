"""Where the vendored assets are, resolved once.

Every asset path used to be derived from the module's own __file__. That worked
while everything lived in one file at the repository root and broke silently the
moment the code moved into a package: the Go2 policy lookup fell through to a
fine-tuned checkpoint sitting elsewhere on the author's machine, and the demo
ran with the wrong policy without saying so.
