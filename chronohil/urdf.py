    """Two things in a stock Go2 URDF that Chrono cannot take.

    1. Links with no <inertial>.  The Go2 has eight, collision-only cylinders
       bolted to the calves, and the parser SEGFAULTS on them rather than
       complaining.  They are GIVEN a tiny inertial rather than deleted.

       Deleting them was the obvious fix and it is wrong. Those eight are the
       `calflower` links: the lower shin, and the foot hangs off the end of
       them. Drop the link and the joint that references it and the foot
       re-attaches higher up, so the robot is standing on a leg shorter than the
       one any Go2 policy was ever trained on -- which is invisible until you
       put a trained policy on it and it crouches instead of standing. A gram
       and a 1e-6 inertia keeps the chain, keeps the geometry, and is small
       enough not to matter dynamically.
    2. Collada visuals.  Chrono reads meshes with tiny_obj, so a .dae is fed to
       a Wavefront parser, fails, and then segfaults.  The visual meshes are
       dropped and the collision primitives are drawn instead -- this URDF
       describes itself in 5 boxes, 17 cylinders and 5 spheres, which is blocky
       but complete, and it is the physics we are here to push on anyway.
