"""Reading the 3D window by asking the X server. Optional, and a last resort.

NOTHING IN demos/ IMPORTS THIS DIRECTLY. It is selected, if it is selected at
all, by chronohil.input.window, and the demos see the same interface either way.

It exists for the same reason the macOS sibling does: PyChrono cannot hand
Python the events of its own window -- see native.py for the one line in
Chrono's SWIG interface that removes the need for every file in here -- so the
three things a mouse needs have to be asked of the operating system instead:

    XQueryPointer   where the cursor is AND whether button 1 is down, in ONE
                    round trip, in the coordinates of any window we name
    XQueryKeymap    which keys are down, server-wide, focus or not
    XQueryTree      the window tree, to find OUR window by the title Chrono
                    gave it; _NET_CLIENT_LIST first where a WM publishes one
    XGetGeometry    how big that window actually turned out to be, which is
                    not always the size Chrono asked for

WHY ctypes AND NOT python-xlib: python-xlib is not in environment.yml and is
not installed in the tutorial env on either machine this was developed on, so a
python-xlib path would be dead code everywhere the demos are run as documented,
and an unexercised second code path is a second place for this to rot. ctypes
reaches libX11.so.6 -- the very copy Irrlicht already has mapped -- and needs
nothing installed at all. The rule the rest of this package follows is that a
backend may not add a dependency; this one adds none.

WAYLAND CANNOT DO ANY OF IT, by design and not by omission: no Wayland client
may ask where the pointer is while it is over someone else's surface, and none
may ask where another window sits. There is nothing to fall back to, so this
says so plainly and returns None, and the demo opens its own input window.
