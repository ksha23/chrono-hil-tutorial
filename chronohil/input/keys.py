"""Input from a small window of our own. Portable: pygame, nothing else.

This is the fallback every platform can run. It cannot read the 3D window --
see chronohil.input.window for why that is hard and what fixes it -- so it
offers the same actions through keys instead.
"""

class LocalInput:
    """A small pygame window in this same process, so one command is enough.

    PyChrono still cannot read the Irrlicht window (SWIG directors are off, and
    getCursorControl() returns an unwrapped object), so the keys have to be read
    by something else -- but that something does not have to be another process.
    pygame and Irrlicht coexist happily in a single process.

    Same interface as the 3D-window backends, so the loop cannot tell them
    apart.
